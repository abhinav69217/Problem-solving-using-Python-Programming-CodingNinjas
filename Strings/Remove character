For a given a string(str) and a character X, write a function to remove all the occurrences of X from the given string.
The input string will remain unchanged if the given character(X) doesn't exist in the input string.
Input Format:
The first line of input contains a string without any leading and trailing spaces.

The second line of input contains a character(X) without any leading and trailing spaces.
Output Format:
The only line of output prints the updated string. 
Note:
You are not required to print anything explicitly. It has already been taken care of.
Constraints:
0 <= N <= 10^6
Where N is the length of the input string.

Time Limit: 1 second
Sample Input 1:
aabccbaa
a
Sample Output 1:
bccb
Sample Input 2:
xxyyzxx
y
Sample Output 2:
xxzxx



Answer:-


from sys import stdin


def removeAllOccurrencesOfChar(string, ch):
    for i in ch:
        string = string.replace(ch, '')
    return string
# main
string = stdin.readline().strip()
ch = stdin.readline().strip()[0]

ans = removeAllOccurrencesOfChar(string, ch)

print(ans)
